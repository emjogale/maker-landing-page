## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I looked into various ways of centering content - using flexbox and other approaches.
- I went for the flexbox approach and realised that flexbox isn't just for the main layout of a page but can be used in small sections.
- I learnt you can change the display of a heading element to inline-block so you can absolutely position a span against the text within the heading.
- An interesting challenge was finding out how to change the colour of an SVG image - by changing the 'fill' propery in the SVG file.
- I learnt how to use the :nth-child selector to style alternating siblings differently.

### Continued development

- When using the mobile first development approach, I need to spend more time pre-planning to take into consideration the different screen size layouts. This should help with the structure of the html so it works for each screen size without too much alteration.
- I need to look into the background property and how the various properties such as background position affect its use.

### Useful resources

- [How to Center an Image Vertically and Horizontally with Css](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-css/) - This helped me with centering the smaller images within their containers.
- [How to Change the Colors of SVG Graphics](https://ggnome.com/wiki/how-to-change-the-colors-of-scalable-vector-graphics) - This explained changing the 'fill' property of an SVG to change its colour.
- [Flexbox cheatsheet](https://jonitrythall.com/content/flexboxsheet.pdf) - I found this a useful resource for clarifying the flexbox properties.
