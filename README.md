## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesn’t look like an email address"

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I learnt about centering images within a container. I went for the flexbox approach and realised that flexbox isn't just for the main layout of a page but can be used in small sections.
I learnt you can change the diplay of an heading element to inline-block so you can absolutely position a span against the text within the heading.
I discovered how to change the colour of an SVG image - by changing the 'fill' propery in the SVG file.
I learnt how to use the :nth-child selector to style alternating siblings differently.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [How to Center an Image Vertically and Horizontally with Css](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-css/) - This helped me with centering the smaller images within their containers.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
